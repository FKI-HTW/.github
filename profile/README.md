### Forschungs- und Weiterbildungszentrum Kultur und Informatik

Welcome!

The [Forschungs- und Weiterbildungszentrum Kultur und Informatik](https://fki.htw-berlin.de/) (FKI) on the Wilhelminenhof campus of [HTW Berlin](https://www.htw-berlin.de/) unites three interdisciplinary research groups under one roof. In exchange with a global network of top-class partners from research and business, specialists in innovative technologies such as virtual, mixed and augmented reality, human-computer interaction, gaming and artificial intelligence work successfully together with experts from cultural studies, the arts and creative industries, as well as urban planning and medicine.

The FKI serves the exchange and transfer of knowledge, the joint development of new projects, practical tests in laboratories set up for this purpose as well as public presentations, discussions and events in the spacious premises directly on the Spree.
